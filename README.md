# Instructions for Problem Set #2

* Start with this README.
* There are two other documents in this repo: ps_2_assignment.Rmd and ps_2_assignment.html. The second is knitted from the first, just as you might expect.
* Within RStudio, you can read the assignment in two ways. One, click on ps_2_assignment.html and select the "View in Web Browser" option. Second, open ps_2_assignment.Rmd in RStudio and then knit it.
* We provide both the .Rmd and the .html so that you can see how we went from the first to the second.
* The assignment provides specific instructions. Follow them closely.
